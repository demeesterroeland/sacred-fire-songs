## What it does

Sacred Fire Songs is a collaborative web app for ceremony musicians to store, share, and perform medicine songs. Songs are written in [ChordPro](https://www.chordpro.org/) notation — chords sit above lyrics in a clean, readable format that works on any screen size.

It's designed for **use in ceremony**: large readable text, screen wake lock so the display never sleeps, real-time transposition, and a mobile-first layout that works offline as an installed PWA.

## Features

- **ChordPro editor** — full ChordPro notation with live auto-sizing and smart paste from any text source
- **Transposition** — music-theory-aware key shifting (C → G, Am → Em, etc.) powered by ChordSheetJS
- **Playlists / Setlists** — build ordered setlists with drag-and-drop, shareable links, and visibility control
- **Category filtering** — 32 subcategories across 6 groups (Elements, Nature, Language, Lineage, Healing, Spiritual) — see [`docs/design/categories.md`](docs/design/categories.md)
- **Screen Wake Lock** — keeps the screen on during ceremony so songs stay visible
- **Role-based access** — Guest → Member → Gatekeeper → Admin; gatekeepers review and curate the song library
- **PWA** — installable on any phone or tablet; launches in standalone mode with branded splash screen
- **Auth** — email + magic link via Supabase, with onboarding flow
